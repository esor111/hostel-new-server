# Multi-Guest Booking Service Implementation

## Overview

The Multi-Guest Booking Service is a comprehensive solution for managing bed-level bookings in a hostel management system. It enables mobile app users to book multiple beds for different guests in a single booking request, while providing administrators with tools to manage, confirm, and track these bookings.

## Features Implemented

   - Validates bed availability before creating bookings
   - Checks gender compatibility between guests and beds
   - Prevents duplicate bed assignments within the same booking
   - Automatically reserves beds temporarily upon booking creation
   - Uses database transactions to ensure data consistency

2. **Booking Confirmation Logic that Assigns Beds to Guests**
   - Confirms pending bookings and assigns beds to guests
   - Handles partial confirmations when some beds become unavailable
   - Updates bed status from Reserved to Occupied
   - Records occupant information in bed entities
   - Tracks confirmation timestamps and processing user

3. **Booking Cancellation with Bed Release**
   - Cancels bookings and releases associated beds
   - Updates bed status back to Available
   - Clears occupant information from bed entities
   - Records cancellation reason and processing details
   - Prevents cancellation of completed bookings

4. **Booking Statistics and Reporting Functionality**
   - Provides comprehensive booking statistics
   - Tracks confirmation rates and guest counts
   - Calculates average guests per booking
   - Supports date range filtering for reports
   - Includes revenue estimation based on bed rates

### ✅ Additional Features

5. **Advanced Query and Search Capabilities**
   - Paginated booking lists with multiple filters
   - Search by contact information or booking reference
   - Filter by status, date range, and source
   - Sort by creation date and other criteria

6. **Validation and Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive bed availability validation
   - Gender compatibility checking
   - Duplicate bed assignment prevention
   - Detailed error messages with specific failure reasons
   - Transaction rollback on errors

7. **Booking Lifecycle Management**

```

## Validation Rules

### Bed Availability Validation
- Bed must exist in the system
- Bed status must be 'Available'
- No duplicate bed assignments within the same booking
- Gender compatibility check (if bed has gender restrictions)

### Booking Validation
- Contact person information is required
- At least one guest must be specified
- Guest age must be between 1 and 120
- Guest gender must be valid enum value
- Bed identifiers must follow the format (bed1, bed2, etc.)

### Status Transition Rules
```
Booking Status Transitions:
Pending → Confirmed
Pending → Partially_Confirmed
Pending → Cancelled
Confirmed → Completed
Confirmed → Cancelled
Partially_Confirmed → Completed
Partially_Confirmed → Cancelled

Guest Status Transitions:
Pending → Confirmed
Pending → Cancelled
Confirmed → Checked_In
Checked_In → Checked_Out
Confirmed → Cancelled
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Bed Not Found**: When specified bed identifiers don't exist
2. **Bed Not Available**: When beds are already occupied or reserved
3. **Gender Mismatch**: When guest gender doesn't match bed restrictions
4. **Duplicate Bed Assignment**: When same bed is assigned to multiple guests
5. **Booking Not Found**: When trying to operate on non-existent booking
6. **Invalid Status Transition**: When trying to perform invalid status changes

### Error Response Format
```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "details": {
    "field": "guests[0].bedId",
    "code": "BED_NOT_AVAILABLE",
    "bedId": "bed1",
    "reason": "Bed is already occupied"
  },
  "timestamp": "2024-02-01T10:00:00Z"
}
```

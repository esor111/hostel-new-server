   - **Resolution:** Created tables manually with proper schema
   - **Status:** Tables now exist and functional

2. **API Endpoint Configuration** - ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - **Issue:** Incorrect base URL in test scripts (port 3000 vs 3001)
   - **Resolution:** Updated all test scripts to use correct URL
   - **Status:** All endpoints now accessible

3. **Phone Number Validation** - ‚úÖ IDENTIFIED
   - **Issue:** Strict phone number format validation (10-15 characters, specific format)
   - **Resolution:** Updated test data to use proper phone number formats
   - **Status:** Validation working correctly

### ‚ùå Outstanding Issues

1. **Multi-Guest Booking Bed Validation** - ‚ùå NEEDS ATTENTION
   - **Issue:** Bed ID validation requires specific format (bed1, bed2, etc.)
   - **Impact:** Multi-guest bookings fail when using non-standard bed IDs
   - **Recommendation:** Either create test beds or relax validation for testing
   - **Priority:** Medium (enhancement opportunity)

  - Total bookings count
  - Pending/confirmed/cancelled counts
  - Total and confirmed guests
  - Confirmation rate calculation
  - Average guests per booking

### 2. Service Layer Implementation

Complete service implementation in `src/bookings/multi-guest-booking.service.ts`:

#### ✅ Core Business Logic
- **Booking Creation**: Full validation and bed reservation
- **Booking Confirmation**: Bed assignment with conflict handling
- **Booking Cancellation**: Bed release and status updates
- **Statistics Generation**: Comprehensive booking metrics
- **Query Operations**: Filtering, pagination, search

#### ✅ Validation Features
- Bed availability validation
- Gender compatibility checking
- Duplicate bed assignment prevention
- Booking status validation
- Date range validation

#### ✅ Transaction Support
- Database transactions for data consistency
- Rollback on errors
- Atomic operations for multi-step processes

### 3. Database Schema

#### ✅ Tables Created
- `multi_guest_bookings` - Main booking records
- `booking_guests` - Individual guest records
- Proper indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity

#### ✅ Entity Relationships
- `MultiGuestBooking` ↔ `BookingGuest` (One-to-Many)
- `BookingGuest` → `Bed` (via bed_identifier)
- Proper TypeORM entity definitions with relationships

### 4. DTOs and Validation

#### ✅ Request DTOs
- `CreateMultiGuestBookingDto` - Booking creation payload
- `ContactPersonDto` - Contact person validation
- `GuestDto` - Guest information validation
- Comprehensive validation rules (email, age, gender, etc.)

#### ✅ Response Formats
- Consistent API response structure
- Proper error handling and messages
- Detailed booking information in responses

### 5. Error Handling

#### ✅ Validation Errors
- Bed not found errors
- Bed availability conflicts
- Gender compatibility issues
- Duplicate bed assignments
- Invalid booking status transitions

#### ✅ Business Logic Errors
- Booking not found
- Invalid status for operations
- Partial confirmation handling
- Transaction rollback on failures

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Database Migrations
- ✅ Migration `1756966300000-CreateMultiGuestBookingEntities.ts` created
- ✅ Tables and indexes created successfully
- ✅ Foreign key constraints established

### Entity Relationships Fixed
- ✅ Fixed string-based relationships to proper TypeORM relationships
- ✅ Proper imports and type definitions
- ✅ Cascade operations configured

### API Response Format
All endpoints return consistent format:
```json
{
  "status": 200|201,
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

### Logging and Monitoring
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for all operations
- ✅ Success and error logging
- ✅ Performance tracking
- ✅ Business event logging

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test Scripts Created
1. `test-multi-guest-booking-api.js` - Full API testing
2. `verify-multi-guest-api-implementation.js` - Comprehensive verification

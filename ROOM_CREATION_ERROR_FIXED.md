# ✅ Room Creation Error - FIXED

## Error Message
```
duplicate key value violates unique constraint "UQ_e38efca75345af077ed83d53b6f"
```

## Problem
Room number "123" already existed in the database, and the system had a **global unique constraint** on room numbers, preventing any hostel from using the same room number.

## Root Cause
```typescript
// ❌ BEFORE - Wrong constraint
@Column({ length: 20, unique: true })
roomNumber: string;
```

This meant:
- Only ONE room with number "123" could exist across ALL hostels
- Hostel A creates Room 123 ✅
- Hostel B tries to create Room 123 ❌ (fails)

## Solution
Changed to **unique per hostel**:

```typescript
// ✅ AFTER - Correct constraint
@Index(['roomNumber', 'hostelId'], { unique: true })
@Column({ length: 20 })
roomNumber: string;
```

Now:
- Each hostel can have its own Room 123 ✅
- Hostel A: Room 123 ✅
- Hostel B: Room 123 ✅
- Hostel C: Room 123 ✅

## What Was Done

1. **Updated Entity** (`room.entity.ts`)
   - Removed global unique constraint
   - Added composite unique index on `(roomNumber, hostelId)`

2. **Created Migration** (`1760083000000-UpdateRoomNumberConstraint.ts`)
   - Drops old constraint
   - Creates new composite index

3. **Executed Migration**
   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```
   Result: ✅ Success

## Test It Now

Try creating your room again with room number "123":

```json
POST /rooms
{
  "name": "maue",
  "roomNumber": "123",
  "bedCount": 3,
  "monthlyRate": 12000,
  "gender": "Mixed",
  "hostelId": "5a58d5e7-f8e7-4a64-89f3-f984f156190f",
  ...
}
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Success!

## Important Notes

- ✅ Different hostels can now use the same room numbers
- ✅ Same hostel cannot have duplicate room numbers (still enforced)
- ✅ No data loss - all existing rooms preserved
- ✅ Migration is reversible if needed

## Files Changed

- `src/rooms/entities/room.entity.ts`
- `src/migrations/1760083000000-UpdateRoomNumberConstraint.ts`

## Status

🎉 **FIXED AND READY TO USE**

You can now create rooms with any room number, as long as it's unique within the same hostel!
